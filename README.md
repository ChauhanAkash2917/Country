🏆 **Objective**:
To create a simple yet interactive webpage that presents country details and allows users to search for specific countries.

**🛠 Technologies Used:**
HTML – For structuring the web page
CSS – For styling the country cards and layout
JavaScript – For fetching API data, rendering country cards, and handling user interactions

**Project Features**

🌍 **1. Fetching Country Data**
The project retrieves country data from the REST Countries API (https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all) using JavaScript’s fetch() method. The API provides details such as:

Country name
Flag
Population
Region
Capital

📌 **2. Displaying Country Cards**
Each country is displayed as a card, containing:
✅ The country’s flag
✅ The country’s name
✅ The population (formatted for readability)
✅ The region (e.g., Asia, Europe, Africa)
✅ The capital city

🔍 **3. Search Functionality**
Users can search for countries by name using an input field. As they type, the country list updates in real-time, displaying only countries that match the search query.

**Code Workflow**
1️⃣ Fetch data from the API
2️⃣ Store the data in a variable
3️⃣ Loop through the data and create country cards dynamically
4️⃣ Insert the cards into the webpage
5️⃣ Filter the country list based on user input

**Possible Enhancements** 🚀
✅ Add Dark Mode – Switch between light and dark themes
✅ Country Details Page – Click on a country card to view more details
✅ Region Filtering – Allow users to filter countries by region
